# Personal Portfolio Website

A simple website used to display my work experience and any projects I find interesting.

## To Do
- [x] Deploy Website
- [ ] Add some projects and display them in projects page
- [ ] Make page responsive & mobile friendly
- [ ] Refactor components to use CSS instead of tailwind (Hard to read atm & lots of repeated text. Will still use tailwind for slight tweaks.)
